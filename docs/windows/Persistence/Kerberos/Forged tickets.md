Silver, Golden, Diamond and Sapphire tickets are similar variants of forged Kerberos tickets, for different purposes and stealth levels, that can be used with pass-the-ticket to access services in an Active Directory domain.

- When one of `krbtgt`'s Kerberos keys is known, a golden ticket (or diamond, or sapphire) attack can be conducted to keep privileged access until that account's password is changed.
- Let service be an account in charge of various services indicated in its `ServicePrincipalNames` attribute, when one of service's Kerberos keys is known, a silver ticket attack can be conducted to keep privileged access to those managed services until that account's password is changed.
